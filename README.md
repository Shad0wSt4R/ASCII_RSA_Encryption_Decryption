# ASCII_RSA_Encryption_Decryption
Will encrypt and decrypt a message based on ASCII values of characters entered.

# Verion 1.0
Will make the user type a message to encrypt and make them enter the primes they wish to use for encryption. Then the program will ask the user if they want to decrypt the message they just encrypted.

# Version 2.0 (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
Will ask they user upon start up if they would like to encrypt or decrypt. 
- Encryption will still ask for primes to encrypt with. 
- Decryption will now ask for a public key (i.e. encryption key and pq).
